The `monad-batcher` package provides the `Batcher` applicative monad that
batches commands for later more efficient execution.

See the [example](https://github.com/basvandijk/monad-batcher/blob/master/example/example.hs).

This package can be seen as a lightweight form of Simon Marlow's
[haxl](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haxl) package.
